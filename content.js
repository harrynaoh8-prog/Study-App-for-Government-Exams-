                <p>Maharashtra, located in the western peninsular region of India, is a powerhouse of the nation's economy and culture. It was officially formed on <b>1 May 1960</b> following the Bombay Reorganisation Act. Mumbai serves as the capital and the financial nerve center of India, while Nagpur is the winter capital.</p>

                <p>Geographically, the state is defined by its diverse terrain. The <b>Konkan</b> coastal strip lies between the Arabian Sea and the <b>Sahyadri Range</b> (Western Ghats). The Western Ghats act as a climatic barrier and the source of great peninsular rivers like the Godavari and Krishna.
                </p>

                <p>The history of Maharashtra is inseparable from the legacy of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>, who established the Maratha Empire in the 17th century. This heritage is preserved in magnificent structures like Raigad Fort and the rock-cut wonders of <b>Ajanta and Ellora Caves</b>.
                </p>

                <p>Economically, Maharashtra is the most industrialized state in India, home to <b>Bollywood</b> and major ports like JNPT.
