It is known for its sophisticated urban planning, baked brick houses, and elaborate drainage systems. Key cities included Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. They developed new techniques in handicraft and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). The civilization's economy was largely based on trade, facilitated by major advances in transport technology.

    title: "General Knowledge: Comprehensive Maharashtra",
    content: `
        <p>Maharashtra, located in the western peninsular region of India, is a powerhouse of the nation's economy and culture. It was officially formed on <b>1 May 1960</b> following the Bombay Reorganisation Act, which transitioned the former Bombay State into the linguistic states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Mumbai, originally a cluster of seven islands, serves as the capital and the financial nerve center of India. Nagpur is designated as the winter capital, hosting the 'Winter Session' of the state legislature.</p>

        <p>Geographically, the state is defined by its diverse terrain. The <b>Konkan</b> coastal strip lies between the Arabian Sea and the <b>Sahyadri Range</b> (Western Ghats). The Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage site, act as a climatic barrier and the source of great peninsular rivers like the Godavari and Krishna. To the east lies the vast <b>Deccan Plateau</b>, characterized by fertile black basalt soil (Regur), ideal for cotton cultivation.</p>

        

        <p>The history of Maharashtra is inseparable from the legacy of <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>. In the 17th century, he established the Maratha Empire, challenging the Mughal dominance through innovative guerrilla warfare and administrative brilliance. This heritage is preserved in magnificent structures like Raigad Fort and the rock-cut wonders of <b>Ajanta and Ellora Caves</b>, which showcase ancient Indian craftsmanship dating back to the 2nd century BCE.</p>

        

        <p>Economically, Maharashtra is the most industrialized state in India. It contributes significantly to the national GDP through its robust service sector, manufacturing hubs in Pune and Thane, and the massive entertainment industry known as <b>Bollywood</b>. Agriculture remains a backbone, with the state leading in the production of Alphonso mangoes, grapes, and sugarcane. Culturally, the state is vibrant, celebrated through the grand <b>Ganesh Chaturthi</b> festival and folk traditions like Lavani music and the Tamasha theater.</p>
