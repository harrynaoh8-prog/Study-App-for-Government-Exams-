            content: "The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern regions of South Asia, lasting from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. It is known for its sophisticated urban planning, baked brick houses, and elaborate drainage systems. Key cities included Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. They developed new techniques in handicraft and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). The civilization's economy was largely based on trade, facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The script remains undeciphered, making their political structure a matter of speculation.",
